# 🎮 2D Game Engine

## Overview
This project is a simple **2D Game Engine** built in C# using **MonoGame**.  
The engine provides a modular foundation for building 2D games, with a focus on **clean architecture**, **SOLID principles**, and learning software engineering concepts in game development.

---

## 🚀 Features 
- **Game Loop** with consistent timing (`EngineTime`)  
- **Input Management** through `InputManager` for Keyboard/GamePad  
- **Player Entity** with movement controlled by input  
- Basic **integration of core systems** in `Game1.cs`

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- C#  
- MonoGame Framework  
- Visual Studio / VS Code  
- Markdown (for documentation in Obsidian)

---

## 🎯 Goals
1. Learn how to design and implement a modular 2D game engine.  
2. Practice software engineering principles (SOLID, KISS).  
3. Maintain **documentation alongside development** using Agile methodology.  
4. Provide a base engine for building small 2D games.
