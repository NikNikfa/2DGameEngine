# What is `GraphicsDevice` in MonoGame?

`GraphicsDevice` is the **low-level GPU interface** in [[1. MonoGame Framework]] — the foundation of all rendering.

Think of it like this:

### GraphicsDevice = “The GPU Manager of the Engine”

It controls:

- The backbuffer (your game’s screen)
    
- Clearing the screen
    
- Setting render targets
    
- Handling textures
    
- Creating buffers and shaders
    
- Enabling/disabling blend states
    
- Controlling the viewport/camera projection
    
- Telling the GPU: “Start drawing!” / “Stop drawing!”
    

It is the **lowest-level graphics API** before OpenGL/DirectX.

## **How GraphicsDevice fits in Engine Architecture**

```scss
RenderingSystem → SpriteBatch → GraphicsDevice → GPU (OpenGL/DirectX)
```

### Your Rendering System uses SpriteBatch

SpriteBatch uses GraphicsDevice  
GraphicsDevice actually talks to the GPU

## Key Responsibilities of GraphicsDevice

### 1. **Clearing the screen**

```csharp
GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);
```

### 2. **Managing the Backbuffer / RenderTargets**

```csharp
GraphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget(myRenderTarget);
```

### 3. **Managing Global GPU State**

- Blend state
    
- Sampler state
    
- Depth stencil state
    
- Rasterizer state
    

### 4. **Managing Textures and Buffers**

- Create textures
    
- Upload texture data to GPU
    
- Manage vertex/index buffers
    

### 5. **Handling Viewports**

```csharp
var viewport = GraphicsDevice.Viewport;
```

### Note:

You **almost never draw directly** with `GraphicsDevice`.  
Instead, you use **SpriteBatch**, which simplifies the rendering pipeline.
