## Notes
- **Priority**: High = must-have for the initial engine, Medium = important but can wait for later sprints, Low = optional/future improvement.  
- **Status**: Pending, In Progress, Done.  
- Each user story should be linked in Obsidian to its corresponding **Implementation** and **Design** documentation.
